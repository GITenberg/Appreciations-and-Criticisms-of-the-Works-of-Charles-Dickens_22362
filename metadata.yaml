description: 'Published in 1911, here is a gathering of the prefaces that Chesterton
  wrote for more than twenty of Dickens''s novels. With quintessential Chesterton
  wit, the chapters display his supreme admiration for Dickens. He writes: Dickens
  must definitely be considered in light of the changes which his soul foresaw. Thackeray
  has become classical; Dickens has done more; he has remained modern &#8230; he belongs
  to the times since his death.'
